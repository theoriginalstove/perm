## Installation

Until the extension is accepted and the [PR](https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions/pull/1158) is merged into [the Zed extensions repo](https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions)
manual installation as as `Dev Extension` is required.

1. Clone this repo locally
2. In the Extensions - `Install Dev Extension`
3. Select the local repo folder

> [!NOTE]
> If the extension is already installed, you may get an error that grammars exist when checking the logs. To fix
> this, delete the grammars directory that was created in the local repo when installing and choose rebuild if you're trying
> to update to the latest `tree-sitter-perm`.
